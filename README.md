# Personal Homepage with Blog

This repository contains a minimal static website that includes a personal homepage and a simple blog. There is no build step; open `index.html` in a browser to view the site.

The design takes inspiration from the clean look of [eyr.md](https://eyr.md) with a blueâ€“green gradient header and light page background. A short tagline appears beneath each page heading, and blog posts show publication dates.

## Structure

- `index.html` - Main page with a brief introduction and navigation links.
- `blog.html` - Blog listing page.
- `posts/` - Folder containing individual blog posts as HTML files.
- `style.css` - Shared stylesheet used by all pages.

## Usage

Clone the repository and open `index.html` in any web browser:

```bash
$ git clone <repo>
$ cd chatgpt_codex_1
$ xdg-open index.html # or open index.html with your preferred browser
```
